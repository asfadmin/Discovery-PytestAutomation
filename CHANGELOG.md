## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-PytestAutomation/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0)

### Changed:
- Improved error checking and error messages, for misformed yml tests and `test_types`. Removed the extra warning when plugin collects an empty test_*.yml file.

- Moved code to figure out version, from `setup.py` to `automation/__init__.py`. This lets me populate `__version__` from there.

### Removed:
- Removed automatically ignoring git submodules. Can only ignore files loaded by this plugin and not vanilla pytest tests anyways, so switching to pytest's `--ignore <dir>` flag for this functionality.

- Figured out how to remove the single global statement, by changing how each file imports one another.

------

## [v1.0.0](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-PytestAutomation/compare/v0.0.1...v1.0.0)

First major release!

### Added:
- Changelog action, to guantee this file is updated on releases.

- Added with `required_in_title` as an option to each `test_types`, that checks it's value against the title of each test. (Replacement for `required_files`. More info [here](https://github.com/asfadmin/Discovery-PytestAutomation/tree/stable#pytest-configyml-example)).

- Python `type hints` to most functions.

- Instructions on installing package from source in `README.md`

### Changed:
- `pytest_managers.py` and `pytest_config.yml` have been renamed to `pytest-managers.py` and `pytest-config.yml`. This is because '_' is inconsistent between Markdown anchors, but '-' isn't.

### Removed:
- Removed `required_files` key as an option from `test_types`. Decided each test should run exactly the same, regardless of what file it's in. (Allows you to have a "known_bugs.yml" you can move tests in/out of).

### Fixed:
- Empty test_*.yml's used to stop test suite from running, since the parser returned `None` instead of a empty string.
